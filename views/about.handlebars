        About Viral Support
    </h1>
    <p>
        Viral Support was made to help people struggling with COVID-19. Because of this pandemic, many people must deal with loss, fear, and loneliness. It's easy to get lost in the overwhelming amount of misinformation regarding COVID-19. Viral Support provides a way to stay connected with others and offers references to real-time, fact-checked information to help keep you safe. We want our users to feel safe and well informed as well as finding some comfort in connecting with people with shared experiences.
