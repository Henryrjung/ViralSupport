ViralSupport is a COVID-19 resource center aimed to provide relevent information/data to those seeking it. 

## User Story

User Story: As someone has been affected by the corona virus, I want a site that provides me with information about about covid19 stats and safety tips. This site should allow me to chat with others and share testimonies or experiences. I should be able to create a profile that saves my information and enables other users to provide support
